A bit more about the process of creating this blog, why and how, and what I've learned so far...

## Introduction

Mkdocs was not my first choice when deciding to start a blog. We're going to explore what went through my mind during the decision-making process and why I ended up choosing Mkdocs.

## Starting with Hugo

It was pretty straightforward to get the basics up and running, just follow the [Hugo Quick Start Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and you're good to go. It's the step after that I found harder, especially around the customization of the theme, to my liking.

I know there are a lot of themes available, but I failed to find one that I really like, and when I almost did, I didn't manage to customize it to my liking. There was always a little something bothering me or not working: Search, Table of Contents, etc.

Please, don't get me wrong, I've got absolutely nothing against Hugo, it may suits your needs perfectly, but it didn't suit mine.

## Trying Mkdocs

At our company, we use Mkdocs for our documentation, and I've always liked the simplicity and the look of it. I've also found it easy to customize, and I've always been happy with the results.
