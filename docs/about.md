ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to NoodleOps ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction

NoodleOps is a blog where I'll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge on a wide range of topics, with a focus on networking and technology.

The idea behind this blog is to create a space where I can track and document the various projects I've been working on, as well as share the lessons I've learned along the way.

## About [Me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seb-dargoeuves/)

I'm a seasoned network engineer with a passion for technology, networking, and security. With over 15 years of experience in the IT industry, I've developed a strong background in networking, with a focus on routing, switching, security, and automation.

I'm a firm believer in the power of automation and its ability to transform networks.

As a Solution Architect at IP Fabric, I help innovative companies unlock their network's full potential by shedding light on blind spots, streamlining operations, and harnessing automation to drive business value. I empower them to simplify network management, reduce costs, and focus on delivering exceptional services and experiences to their customers.
