👋 Welcome to NoodleOps 👋

## Introduction

`NoodleOps` is a blog where I'll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge on a wide range of topics, with a focus on networking and technology.

The name `⁠NoodleOps` might raise a few eyebrows, so let me explain the inspiration behind it. Firstly, I'm a fan of the song "Noodles" by Shrezzers[^1] 🎸🎶 - it's a great tune that always gets me pumped up. Secondly, I drew inspiration from the word `⁠noodle` itself and this specific definition[^2].

!!! note "Definition"
    **noodle**: to play, to improvise, experiment, or think creatively

    _The writers noodled for a week and came up with a better idea for the ad campaign._

This definition resonates with me because it encapsulates the spirit of experimentation and creativity that I want to bring to this blog.

Through `⁠NoodleOps`, I aim to create a space where I can track and document my projects, share my experiences, and reflect on the lessons I've learned along the way, so that you can benefit from them too.
