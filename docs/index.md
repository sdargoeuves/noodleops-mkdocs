# Blog

<!-- > The blog contains... everything. Quick references, miscellaneous tutorials, conference notes, and so on. It's a blog as brain with a tech focus. For many of the posts, I am the primary intended audience: the blog is there so I can quickly look up things I need. Others are more tutorial-like, or designed to answer quick questions. The writing style is generally informal, and closer to natural language than I'd use in documentation. I don't reliably maintain and update the content in this section.
