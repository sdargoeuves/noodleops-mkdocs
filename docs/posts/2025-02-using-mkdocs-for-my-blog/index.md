End of 2024, I decided to start a blog. This post is about the process of choosing Mkdocs for my blog...

## Introduction

In the end of 2024, I decided to start this blog. I used to keep my notes in random files located in multiple directories. Let's just say, it isn't the most efficient way to keep track of what I did, especially when I needed to refer back to something I did a few months ago.

So here we are, ready to start a blog! What should I do next? I've heard a lot of good things about Hugo, so I decided to give it a try.

## Starting with Hugo

It was pretty straightforward to get up and running, just follow the [Hugo Quick Start Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and you're good to go. It's the step after that I found harder, especially around the customization of the theme.

I know there are a lot of themes available, but I failed to find one that I really like. There was always a little something bothering me or not working: Search, Table of Contents, etc. I could have decided to go with one theme that was ok, and **start**, instead of procrastinating around it, but I didn't... I wanted a solution that would suit my needs better.

Please, don't get me wrong, I've got absolutely nothing against Hugo, it may suits your needs perfectly, but it didn't suit mine.

## Using Mkdocs

At our company, we use Mkdocs for our documentation, and I like the simplicity and the look of it. When I saw that they have a [plugin for blog](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/blog/), it did it for me! I decided to give it a try.
