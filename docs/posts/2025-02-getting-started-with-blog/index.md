title: 'Getting started with the blog'
---

Late in 2024, I  decided to start writing my own blog. This post is about the journey to get to what you are now reading...
<!-- more -->

I used to keep my notes scattered across random files in multiple directories. Let's just say, it isn't the most efficient way to keep track of what I did, especially when I needed to refer back to something I did a few months ago.

So here we are, ready to start a blog! What should I do next? I've heard a lot of good things about Hugo, so I decided to give it a try.

## Starting with Hugo

It was pretty straightforward to get the blog up and running. Check the [Hugo Quick Start Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and you're good to go. It was the steps *after* that I found more challenging: choosing a theme and customization.

I know there are a lot of themes available, but I just couldn't find one that really clicked with me. Instead of actually writing, I got completely bogged down trying to find the perfect theme. Each one I tried seemed to be missing something, or had a feature that didn't quite work the way I wanted -- things like Search or Table of Contents. After spending quite some time on this, I decided to look for another solution that would suit my needs better.

And please, don't get me wrong, I have absolutely nothing against Hugo! It might be the perfect solution for many, but it just didn't quite click for *my* needs.

## Choosing MkDocs

At our company, we use MkDocs for our documentation, and more precisely `Material for MkDocs`. I like the simplicity, the look and the fact it's written in python *-- not that I am planning to dive into the code.*

When I saw that they have a [plugin for blog](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/blog/), it did it for me! I decided to give it a try. And also, 22k stars on GitHub, it's a good sign, right? ðŸ˜…

## Discovering my needs

Looking back, this is probably where I should have started â€“ figuring out my needs first. But the problem was, I didn't really know what I needed! It was only when I started playing around with Hugo and different themes that things became clearer, and I began to figure out what I didn't like or what was missing.

Now that I had a clearer picture, here's what was on my wish list:

- [x] Write my posts in Markdown
- [x] No CSS required and very little HTML
- [x] A clean and simple design
- [x] Easy to navigate
- [x] A search function
- [x] A table of contents, that follows you as you scroll

I really feel like Hugo supports a lot of those features, but I struggled especially with the search function and the table of contents. I wasn't fully satisfied with the different themes I tried. Thankfully, Material for MkDocs provides all of these features out of the box, which was a huge relief.

## Starting with Material for MkDocs

The best way to start with Material for MkDocs is to follow the [Getting Started](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/). It's very well written and easy to follow. I won't go into the details here, they've done a much better job than I could ever do.

## My MkDocs setup

To set up this blog, I wanted a pretty simple and standard workflow: edit markdown files, use Git to push those file somewhere and update the blog accordingly.

I initially considered GitHub Pages, but switched to [Cloudflare Pages](https://www.cloudflare.com/pages/) after hearing about it from Ivan Pepelnjak on a podcast (not sure which one) but also on his [blog](https://blog.ipspace.net/2024/07/blog-cloudflare/)) and discovering Deborah Writes' excellent deployment guide: [Deploy and Host MkDocs with Cloudflare Pages guide](https://deborahwrites.com/guides/deploy-host-mkdocs/deploy-mkdocs-material-cloudflare/)

The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/sdargoeuves/noodleops-mkdocs), and updates are automatically deployed to Cloudflare Pages when I update the `main` branch.

I took inspiration for the overall look of this blog from existing resources::

- **Inspirational Tech Writing Blog:** [Deborah Writes](https://deborahwrites.com/blog/)
- **Material for MkDocs Blog:** [Material for MkDocs Blog](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/)
- **Additional MkDocs Examples:** [Andre_601](https://andre601.ch/blog/), [Tim Vink](https://timvink.nl/blog/), [A code to remember](https://copdips.com/)...

## Conclusion

That's it! The foundations are finally in place, or at least, at a point I'm happy with! No more excuses, no more distractions. I can finally stop tinkering with blog setup and actually start writing... now, where do I begin?
