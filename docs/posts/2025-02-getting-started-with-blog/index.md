Near the end of 2024, I decided to start writing my own blog. This post is about the journey to get to what you are now reading...
<!-- more -->
I used to keep my notes in random files located in multiple directories. Let's just say, it isn't the most efficient way to keep track of what I did, especially when I needed to refer back to something I did a few months ago.

So here we are, ready to start a blog! What should I do next? I've heard a lot of good things about Hugo, so I decided to give it a try.

## Starting with Hugo

It was pretty straightforward to get up and running, just follow the [Hugo Quick Start Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and you're good to go. It's the step after that I found harder, especially around the customization of the theme.

I know there are a lot of themes available, but I failed to find one that I really like. There was always a little something bothering me or not working: Search, Table of Contents, etc. I could have decided to go with one theme meeting enough of my requirements, and **start**, instead of procrastinating around it, but I didn't... I wanted a solution that would suit my needs better.

Please, don't get me wrong, I've got absolutely nothing against Hugo, it may suits your needs perfectly, but it didn't suit mine.

## Discovering my needs

This is probably where I should have started, the problem is that I didn't know what I needed. Most of the things I wanted, I only realised after testing with Hugo and different themes by spotting what I didn't like or what was missing.
Now that I have a better idea, here is what I want:

- Write my posts in Markdown
- No css required and very little html
- A clean and simple design
- Easy to navigate
- A search function
- A table of contents, following the post as you scroll
- A way to categorize and tag my posts

I really feel like a lot of those are covered with Hugo, but I struggled especially with the search function and the table of contents. I also wasn't fully satisfied with the different themes I tried.

## Choosing Mkdocs

At our company, we use Mkdocs for our documentation, and more precisely `Material For Mkdocs`. I like the simplicity and the look of it. When I saw that they have a [plugin for blog](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/blog/), it did it for me! I decided to give it a try. And also, 22k stars on GitHub, it's a good sign, right? 😅

## Starting with Mkdocs

The best way to start with Mkdocs is to follow the [Getting Started](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/). It's very well written and easy to follow. I won't go into the details here, they've done a much better job than I could ever do.

## AI Image

I am thinking of adding an AI generated image on each blog post... Let's see how it goes!

This image almost looks like my office... minus the wooden floor, the plants, the size of the room, the windows, the furniture... fair enough, it doesn't look like my office at all!
