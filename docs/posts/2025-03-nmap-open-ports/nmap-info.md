# Security Justification for Nmap Scanning Public IPs on Port 22

## Introduction

Scanning public IP addresses, especially on critical ports like port 22 (SSH), is an essential security practice. This document explains the reasons and benefits of using the provided script to perform such scans.

## Reasons for Scanning Public IPs on Port 22

1. **Identify Unauthorized Access Points**:
    - Port 22 is commonly used for SSH, which provides remote access to systems. Unauthorized or forgotten SSH services can become entry points for attackers.
    - Regular scanning helps identify and remediate unauthorized or unnecessary SSH services.

2. **Detect Vulnerabilities**:
    - Scanning can reveal outdated or misconfigured SSH services that may have known vulnerabilities.
    - Ensuring that all SSH services are up-to-date and properly configured reduces the risk of exploitation.

3. **Monitor Exposure**:
    - Public IPs are accessible from the internet, making them prime targets for attacks.
    - Regular scans help monitor which IPs are exposed and ensure that only intended services are accessible.

4. **Compliance and Auditing**:
    - Many security standards and regulations require regular monitoring and auditing of network services.
    - Scanning public IPs for open ports is a part of maintaining compliance with these standards.

5. **Incident Response**:
    - In the event of a security incident, knowing which IPs and ports are exposed can aid in the investigation and response.
    - Regular scans provide a baseline of normal exposure, making it easier to detect anomalies.

## Benefits of Using the Script

- **Automated Scanning**:
  - The script automates the process of retrieving public IPs and scanning them, saving time and reducing manual effort.

- **Batch Processing**:
  - Scanning IPs in batches improves efficiency and ensures that large sets of IPs can be scanned without overwhelming the network or the scanning tool.
- **Detailed Reporting**:
  - The script generates detailed reports in CSV format, making it easy to analyze and share the results.
- **Integration with IP Fabric**:
  - Leveraging the IP Fabric API ensures that the script works with up-to-date and accurate IP address data.

## Conclusion

Regularly scanning public IPs, especially on critical ports like port 22, is a crucial security practice. It helps identify unauthorized access points, detect vulnerabilities, monitor exposure, maintain compliance, and improve incident response. The provided script automates this process, making it efficient and effective.
