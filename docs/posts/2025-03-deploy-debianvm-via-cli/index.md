Need a Debian VM running locally? Here's how you can create one on your server, just like you would in the cloud of your choice.

## Introduction

Let's face it, spinning up a VM in the cloud for every little test can be overkill, not to mention potentially costly. Sometimes, you just need a VM right here, right now, running locally on your machine or a local server.

Usually, if I need a linux VM to test something locally, I would use [multipass](https://canonical.com/multipass), which allows you to quickly create an Ubuntu VM. I should write a post about multipass; it's a very useful tool for creating local Ubuntu VMs. Unfortunately, multipass doesn't support Debian 😞, only Ubuntu I believe.

For a specific use case, I needed a Debian VM and I wanted to run it on my local server. And by "server," I'm talking about a not-too-old laptop, with 32GB of RAM running Ubuntu. The goal was CLI all the way – no GUI needed, for maximum automation potential.

## TL;DR

Just need the commands to quickly spin that Debian VM on your local server? Head directly to the [**Summary**](#summary) section.

## Prerequisites

You need to have QEMU, libvirt, and virsh installed on your server. When writing this post, I already had these tools installed on my server, so I didn't need to install them. You can check if you have them installed by running the following commands:

``` bash title="Check version of QEMU if installed"
qemu-system-x86 --version
```

``` bash {: .no-copy}
qemu-img version 8.2.2 (Debian 1:8.2.2+ds-0ubuntu1.6)
Copyright (c) 2003-2023 Fabrice Bellard and the QEMU Project developers
```

``` bash title="Check version of virsh if installed"
virsh --version
```

``` bash {: .no-copy}
10.0.0
```

Otherwise, you will have to install the packages, which should look like this [^1]:

[^1]: Your mileage may vary, as this setup was done on an existing Ubuntu server and not a fresh install. You might need additional packages or different versions depending on your system configuration. This guide is based on an x86_64 architecture.

``` bash title="Install QEMU, libvirt, virsh"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install qemu-system-x86 libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients virtinst
```

## Deploy the Debian VM

### Download the Debian image

Thinking about starting with a clean install, I attempted to download the latest iso, but I realised that this is the format for the installer, not the image. With this in mind, I then downloaded the qcow2 `nocloud` image from the [Debian website](https://cloud.debian.org/images/cloud/).

``` bash
curl -LO https://cloud.debian.org/images/cloud/bookworm/latest/debian-12-nocloud-amd64.qcow2
```

### Resize the image

Now, the downloaded image comes in at a compact 3GB.  That's fine for a minimal setup, but if you're planning to do anything substantial inside the VM, you'll quickly run out of space.  Let's resize it to something more practical, like 30GB in our case.

``` bash title="Confirm image size"
qemu-img info debian-12-nocloud-amd64.qcow2
```

``` bash {: .no-copy}
image: debian-12-nocloud-amd64.qcow2
file format: qcow2
virtual size: 3 GiB (3221225472 bytes)
disk size: 397 MiB
cluster_size: 65536
Format specific information:
    compat: 1.1
    compression type: zlib
    lazy refcounts: false
    refcount bits: 16
    corrupt: false
    extended l2: false
Child node '/file':
    filename: debian-12-nocloud-amd64.qcow2
    protocol type: file
    file length: 397 MiB (416745984 bytes)
    disk size: 397 MiB
```

Using `qemu-img`, let's resize the image to 30GB:

``` bash title="Resize the image"
qemu-img resize debian-12-nocloud-amd64.qcow2 30G
```

``` bash {: .no-copy}
Image resized.
```

You can confirm you now have a 30GB image:

``` bash title="Confirm image size"
qemu-img info debian-12-nocloud-amd64.qcow2
```

``` bash {: .no-copy}
image: debian-12-nocloud-amd64.qcow2
file format: qcow2
virtual size: 30 GiB (32212254720 bytes)
[...]
```

## Create the VM

With our image prepped, it's time to bring the VM to life! We'll use ⁠virt-install for this.  You could use a raw ⁠qemu command directly, but ⁠virt-install wraps things up nicely and I've used ⁠virsh tools before, so it feels like a comfortable choice for this.

``` bash title="Create the VM"
sudo virt-install \
    --name debipf \
    --memory 8192 \
    --vcpus 4 \
    --disk path=debian-12-nocloud-amd64.qcow2,device=disk,bus=virtio \
    --network network=default,model=virtio \
    --graphics none \
    --os-variant debian12 \
    --accelerate \
    --import
```

Let's break down the options used in the command `virt-install`:

- `--name debipf`: This option sets the name of your VM
- `--memory 8192`: Memory in MB - 8192MB = 8GB RAM for the VM. Adjust as needed!
- `--vcpus 4`: This is the number of virtual CPUs to allocate to the VM.
- `--disk path=debian-12-nocloud-amd64.qcow2,device=disk,bus=virtio`: Points to our downloaded and resized ⁠qcow2 image, and tells the VM to treat it as a ⁠virtio disk.
- `--network network=default,model=virtio`: Sets up networking using the 'default' network and ⁠virtio again for network interface efficiency.
- `--graphics none`: This disables the graphical console for the VM, we're going headless.
- `--os-variant debian12`: Helps ⁠virt-install optimize settings for Debian 12.
- `--accelerate`: Use hardware virtualization extensions for better performance
- `--import`: Tells ⁠virt-install we are importing an existing disk image, not creating a new one from scratch.

After a few seconds, you should see the Debian system booting up and the login prompt appearing. You can now log in and start using your Debian VM, using username `root` and no password.

``` bash {: .no-copy}
[  OK  ] Finished systemd-update-ut… - Record Runlevel Change in UTMP.

### Expand the filesystem

Almost there! Remember we resized the disk image to 30GB?  Well, the filesystem inside the VM still thinks it's only 3GB.  The last crucial step is to expand the filesystem to actually use that extra space we allocated.

``` bash title="Expand the filesystem"
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y cloud-guest-utils
growpart /dev/vda 1
```

``` bash {: .no-copy}
CHANGED: partition=1 start=262144 old: size=6027264 end=6289407 new: size=62652383 end=62914526
```

### Connect to the VM using the console

Need to get into the VM's console directly?  No problem, ⁠virsh console to the rescue:

``` bash title="Connect to the VM"
sudo virsh console debipf
```

### Enable SSH access

If you want to connect to the VM via SSH, you will need to install the `openssh-server` package:

``` bash title="Install openssh-server"
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y openssh-server
```

You just need to copy your SSH public key to the authorized_keys file, and you will be able to connect to your VM via SSH:

``` bash title="Add your SSH public key"
echo "ssh-rsa XXX..." >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

## Delete the VM

If you want to delete the VM, you can use the following command:

``` bash title="Delete the VM"
sudo virsh destroy debipf && sudo virsh undefine debipf --remove-all-storage
```

## Summary

So there you have it! A Debian VM up and running locally via the command line.  Quick, efficient, and perfect for local testing.  Enjoy!

### From the host

``` bash title="Download the Debian image and resize it"
curl -LO https://cloud.debian.org/images/cloud/bookworm/latest/debian-12-nocloud-amd64.qcow2
qemu-img info debian-12-nocloud-amd64.qcow2
qemu-img resize debian-12-nocloud-amd64.qcow2 30G
qemu-img info debian-12-nocloud-amd64.qcow2
```

``` bash title="Create a new Debian VM"
sudo virt-install \
    --name debipf \
    --memory 8192 \
    --vcpus 4 \
    --disk path=debian-12-nocloud-amd64.qcow2,device=disk,bus=virtio \
    --network network=default,model=virtio \
    --graphics none \
    --os-variant debian12 \
    --accelerate \
    --import
```

### From the VM (guest)

``` bash title="Expand the filesystem and enable SSH access"
# Optional: connect to the VM via console
# sudo virsh console debipf
# enter the username
root
# expand the filesystem
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y cloud-guest-utils openssh-server
growpart /dev/vda 1
# add your ssh public key
echo "ssh-rsa XXXXX..." >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
